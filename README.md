# Unity C# Design Patterns

A collection of common design patterns implemented in Unity using C#. This repository provides examples of various patterns to help improve code structure, maintainability, and flexibility in Unity game development.

## Patterns Implemented

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** – Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access.
- **Factory Method** – Creates objects without specifying their exact class.
- **Abstract Factory** – Provides an interface for creating families of related objects.
  
### Behavioral Patterns
- **Command** – Encapsulates requests as objects.
- **State** – Allows an object to change behavior based on state.
- **Strategy** – Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- **Visitor** – Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on.

### Additional Patterns
- **Event Bus** – Implements a centralized message-passing system that allows decoupling of components in an event-driven architecture.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unity-design-patterns.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Explore the `Scripts` folder for pattern implementations.
4. Run the example scenes to see patterns in action.

## Requirements
- Unity 2022+ (or newer)
- C# 8.0+
